# Simple Maintenance Mode
A simple .htaccess rule to tell browsers that your site is currently undergoing maintenance

Add this to your .htaccess and simply `touch .maintenance` in your DocumentRoot to enable maintenance mode. Remove the .maintenance file when you're done and the site will display normally.
